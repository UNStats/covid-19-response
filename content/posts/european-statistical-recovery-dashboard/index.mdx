In December 2020, [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat) launched the
[European Statistical Recovery Dashboard](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/recovery-dashboard/),
which is updated every month and contains monthly and quarterly statistical
indicators relevant for tracking the economic and social recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The Dashboard is proving to be very successful among users and in recent months
a number of additions in terms of coverage and functionalities have been
introduced.

New indicators to track the recovery from the pandemic have been added to two of
the thematic pillars of the dashboard ‘Business and trade’ and ‘People and
work’. A quarterly index of bankruptcy declarations, together with a quarterly
index of registrations of new businesses, has improved the monitoring of
business demography. Moreover, the July dashboard edition saw the addition of a
new indicator that covers one aspect of the environmental impact of the
recovery - the air quality indicator - which measures the monthly average of
NO<sub>2</sub> concentration in European capital cities.

The accompanying
[monthly Eurostat commentary](./recovery-dashboard-commentary-with-charts-sep-2021-final.pdf)
has also been enhanced with graphical analysis focusing on the evolution of key
indicators since the start of the pandemic. A summary table, highlighting the
indicators that are at or beyond pre-pandemic levels, has also recently been
added.

In addition to the increase in coverage, it is now easier to analyse the
indicators: longer time series can be displayed comparing several countries;
customised charts and datasets can be downloaded; and different units can be
selected for some indicators.

However the work is not over – Eurostat is committed to continuous improvement
of the dashboard, in response to the feedback from users, working in close
cooperation with our European Statistical System partners.
