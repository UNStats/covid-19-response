## Global survey points to stalled progress on national statistical systems

In recent years and in multiple fora, governments around the world have
recognized that all countries need to have accessible, timely, and reliable
disaggregated data to measure progress and ensure no one is left behind in the
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. There is also a global
consensus on the need to intensify efforts to transform statistical capacities
in poorer countries.

To modernize and strengthen national statistical systems, the Cape Town Global
Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data was launched in 2017, providing a
framework to operationalize statistical capacity building. It calls on
governments, policymakers, and the international community to mobilize resources
and strengthen partnerships to improve statistical activities and programs,
innovate national statistical systems, and enhance dissemination and use of
data.

But nearly five years later, a just-released global survey of national
statistical offices (NSOs),
[Survey on the Implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/survey-on-the-implementation-of-the-cape-town-global-action-plan-for-sustainable-development-data),
paints a mixed picture of progress. The survey’s results reveal that despite
gradual improvements, the transformative change in national statistical
capacities proposed in the
[Global Action Plan](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/cape-town-global-action-plan/)
has yet to be realized, particularly in low- and middle-income economies.
However, NSOs have continued to function despite the enormous strain the
COVID-19 pandemic has placed on them, attesting to their strength and
resilience.

The survey was conducted jointly online in August and September 2021 by the
[World Bank’s Development Data Group](https://data.worldbank.org/), the
[Statistics Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNSD)](https://unstats.un.org/),
and the
[Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21)](https://paris21.org/).
NSOs from 101 countries participated, providing insights to policymakers and
international partners on their efforts to implement, monitor, and finance the
Global Action Plan.

The first part of the survey, administered to countries in all income groups,
was designed to illuminate global progress toward the six strategic areas
proposed by the Global Action. The second part, geared toward NSOs in low-income
countries eligible for the World Bank’s
[International Development Association (IDA)](https://ida.worldbank.org/en/about)
assistance, solicited information on their financial prospects and needs.

Here are some of the key messages that stand out from the data:

- While most respondent countries have the fundamentals of functioning national
  statistical systems in place, almost half of them have statistical laws that
  came into force more than a decade ago and many lack data privacy and access
  safeguards, highlighting the need for keeping statistical legal frameworks up
  to date in the context of a rapidly changing data ecosystem.

- Coordination of statistical activities between NSOs and partners within and
  outside the national statistical systems has been improving, although
  significant opportunities for further improvements remain, especially in low-
  and lower-middle-income countries, according to the vast majority of
  respondents.

- NSOs identify the compilation and dissemination of metadata and the
  development of an organization-wide open data strategy as top priority areas
  for capacity development. Relatedly, almost nine in ten NSOs report they need
  to strengthen their online data dissemination platforms and tools as well as
  their data visualization and communication capabilities in the next three
  years.

- Two-thirds of NSOs in IDA countries experienced either moderate or severe
  delays in budget disbursement in the last fiscal year, and many relied on
  development aid from external sources, which has decreased during the
  pandemic, to implement their work program.

- In the next three years, NSOs in most IDA countries say they expect to face
  the most significant funding shortages in business and agricultural census as
  well as population and housing census. Health is the most prioritized policy
  sector for NSOs in IDA countries for both on- and off-budget support.

The new survey, which builds on the four previous rounds of
[Survey of National Statistical Offices (NSOs)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/survey-of-national-statistical-offices-nsos-during-covid-19)
during COVID-19, only offers a snapshot of the current state of statistical
capacity around the globe. To keep track of developments, the World Bank and the
United Nations, in coordination with PARIS21, will continue to monitor efforts
to modernize and strengthen national statistical systems through future survey
rounds.

The survey’s results will also inform the work of the World Bank-hosted
[Global Data Facility](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/global-data-facility)
and the Bern Network’s
[Clearinghouse for Financing Development Data](https://smartdatafinance.org/)
that have recently been launched to enable long-term support for statistical
capacity development around the globe. These two innovative mechanisms will work
in tandem to provide previously unprecedented support for the data agenda,
accelerate progress toward the implementation of the Global Action Plan, and
help realize the new social contract for data envisioned by the
[World Development Report 2021: Data for Better Lives](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2021)
and the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
